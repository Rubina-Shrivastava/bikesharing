## Purpose:
### The purpose for this project was to analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City for presentation to investors looking to begin a bikeshare program in Des Moines. While Des Moines is a long way away from the hustle and bustle of NYC, we are find out which data will and will not apply to Des Moines, for that we hvae to find the answer of this quations:
### Who uses bikeshare programs?
### What area of a city sees the most bikeshare usage?
### What time of day are bikes used the most and the least?
### How much are the bikes used and by whom?
## Result:

### we create a set of visualizations to:
### Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
### Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
### Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
## Summary:
### An additional visualizatin that may help investors determine if Citibikes are a good fit for Des Moines include correlating weather data between Des Moines and New York City. Both cities have four seasons, and if there temperatures and weather are similar, than this may also provide a stronger case to investors that Citibikes is a great fit for Des Moines, Iowa.
###  One other visualization I would like to make is the average distance between customers home location and the bike renting location which would allow the customer to adjust for potential biker locations.
### Although I think we have enough evidence to convince our customer to do this even if we are only looking at one month, there are some other visulizations that can further back this claim. If we were to look at the colder months in the city to see how many riders we have in November/December so that the customer can prepare for those months,in order to determine if Citibikes is a good fit for Des Moines, Iowa, analysts visualize population growths between Des Moines and New York City,If population growth for Des Moines is greater than New York City's, the Citibikes has potential to be a great fit for Des Moines





There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis
